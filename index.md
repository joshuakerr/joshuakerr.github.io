## Welcome


I am a student of the history of philosophy, a researcher, and a teacher.

My research focuses on two primary areas. First, I study environmental philosophy, particularly the philosophy of plants. Drawing both on broadly interdisciplinary approaches to plant life and the role of plants in the history of philosophy, I am interested in the challenges plants pose to traditional approaches to ontology and ethics. For more information, see my [dissertation research page.]({{ site.url }}/pages/dissertation.html)

Second, I study the philosophy of literature, particularly poetry. I am interested in the relationship between literature, language, and non-linguistic expression, especially as it emerges in 20th century Continental philosophers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Deleuze. In this respect, I also study literary writers such as Wallace Stevens and Italo Calvino.

As a teacher, I believe philosophy to be an art of interpreting and transforming the world. I strive to help students discover the pleasures of philosophical exploration and develop the capacity for careful interpretation of both philosophical texts and the world around them. I also believe that learning to sympathetically understanding ideas that appear strange and foreign is a fundamental part of education. For these reasons, I enjoy teaching classes in the history of philosophy, especially ancient and modern philosophy, and I like teaching critical thinking and logic.
