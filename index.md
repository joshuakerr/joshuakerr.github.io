I am a student of the history of philosophy, a researcher, and a [teacher.]({{ site.url }}/pages/teaching.html)

My research focuses on two primary areas. First, I study environmental philosophy, particularly the philosophy of plants. Drawing both on broadly interdisciplinary approaches to plant life and the role of plants in the history of philosophy, I am interested in the challenges plants pose to traditional approaches to ontology and ethics. For more information, see my [dissertation research page]({{ site.url }}/pages/dissertation.html). Second, I study the philosophy of literature, particularly poetry. I am interested in the relationship between literature, language, and non-linguistic expression, especially as it emerges in 20th century Continental philosophers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Deleuze. In this respect, I also study literary writers such as Wallace Stevens and Italo Calvino. This work is highlighted along with my educational background and accomplishments in my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.url }}/pages/cv.html).
