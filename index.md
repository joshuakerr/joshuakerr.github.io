I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon studying ancient Greek philosophy and 19th-20th century Continental philosophy.

My primary research project focuses on philosophy of nature, especially vegetality. I engage the history of philosophy with an eye for the challenges plants pose to traditional approaches to ontology and ethics. I also work in the philosophy of language and literature, where I focus upon the embodied physicality of poetic language and the complications it poses for philosophical reflection.
