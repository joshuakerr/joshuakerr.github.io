I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon studying ancient philosophy and 19th-20th century Contintenal philosophy. 

My primary research project focuses on philosophy of nature, especially vegetality. Drawing on broadly interdisciplinary approaches to plant life, I engage the history of philosophy with an eye for the challenges plants pose to traditional approaches to ontology and ethics. I also work in the philosophy of language and literature, where I focus upon the embodied physicality of language and the complications it poses for philosophical reflection.
