### Overview

As a teacher, I am an aspiring generalist that seeks to teach philosophically rich material in a broadly interdisciplinary perspective. I strive to help students discover the pleasures of philosophical exploration and develop the capacity for careful interpretation of both philosophical texts and the world around them. My teaching experience includes a wide array of courses at the introductory and advanced undergraduate levels. The syllabi that I write emphasize giving students a strong background in seminal texts while also enriching that background through diverse perspectives.
