### Experience

Philosophy can be understood as an art of interpreting and transforming the world. I strive to help students discover the pleasures of philosophical exploration and develop the capacity for careful interpretation of both philosophical texts and the world around them. My teaching experience includes a wide array of philosophy courses at the introductory and advanced undergraduate levels. I have also taught courses in the broader humanities, such as history, classics, and English composition.

I have designed original curriculum for twelve courses, including one course proposal to add a new class to my department's upper division course offerings ("Plants and Philosophy"). The syllabi that I write emphasize giving students a strong background in seminal texts in the history while also enriching that background through overlooked and marginalized perspectives from outside the traditional canon.
