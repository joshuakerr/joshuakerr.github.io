## Teaching
As a teacher, I believe philosophy to be an art of interpreting and transforming the world. I strive to help students discover the pleasures of philosophical exploration and develop the capacity for careful interpretation of both philosophical texts and the world around them. I also believe that learning to sympathetically understanding ideas that appear strange and foreign is a fundamental part of education. For these reasons, I am an aspiring generalist in the history of philosophy, especially ancient and modern philosophy, and I enjoy teaching critical thinking and logic.

My teaching experience also includes courses in the broader humanities, such as history and classics, and English composition at both remedial and first-year levels.
