## The Epistle to the Colossians

[1:1] Paul, an apostle from Christ Jesus through God's will <the will of God / divine will> and Timothy the <my> brother, [2] to the holy <saintly> and faithful brothers in Colossae: in Christ be grace and peace to you from God our father <our divine father>.

[3] We are thankful <give/return thanks> to God, the father of our lord, Jesus Christ, at all times offering prayers on your behalf, [4] having heard of your fidelity in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the holy men <saints / holy ones> [5] on account of <because of> of the hope being laid away for <by> you in the heavens, which hope you have heard beforehand in the word of the truth <the account of the truth> from the gospel <of the gospel / the gospel (apposition)> [6] present <having come> to you --- BOTH how in the whole cosmos it <either logos or gospel> is both bearing fruit and growing AND <even as (comparison between two sides)> how in you from the day you heard and acknowledged <epegnwte> the grace of God in truth <acknowledged in truth the grace of God> [7] AND how you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-slave, who is on behalf of you a faithful minister <deacon> of Christ, [8] having made manifest <shown> to us your love in the spirit <spirit / manifest to us in spirit your love>.

[9] On account of this we also, from the day we heard, do not cease in offering prayers and in begging <asking / imploring*> on behalf of you, in order that you may be filled <fulfilled> with respect to the recognition <knowledge> of the will of him in all wisdom and spiritual union <sagacity>, [10] to walk about worthily of the lord unto all obsequience <pleasing>, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing <growing up> in the recognition <knowledge> of God, [11] being empowered in all power according to the might <strength> of his glory <reputation> unto all endurance and forbearance <patience>. With joy [12] being thankful <giving/returning thanks> to the father IMTO having qualified you <made you meet / made you sufficient> for your share <portion> in the clergy from among the saints <of the inheritance of the saints> in the light, [13] who <the father> delivered us from the authority <license/power> of the gloom <darkness> and transferred us to the kingdom of the son of his love, [14] in whom we have ransoming, the quittance <exemption> from errors <errancy/faults>.

>[15] who is an image <semblance/likeness> of <from> the unseen <invisible> God, firstborn among <from> all creation <that was created>, [16] in order that <wherefore> in him was created the whole <the all / all things?>. In the heavens and upon <on> the earth, things seen and things unseen, whether thrones or lordships or empires <rulers/magistrates> or authorities: the whole <the all / all things?> through him and for him has been created. [17] And he himself is before all, and the whole in him stands together <unites>. [18] And he himself is the head <crown> of the body, the church <the body of the church>,

who is a beginning <sovereign>, firstborn among the dead <from the dead ones>, in order that he may become first in every way <come to be all things, being himself first>, [19] wherefore all the pleroma <full and perfect nature> may consent <agree, be glad> to dwell <settle> in him [20 - check word order in this verse] and to reconcile again through him the whole <the all / all things> for <to / unto> him, having made peace through the bloodshed of his cross, <text.var.: "through him,"> whether things on the earth or things in the heavens.

[21] And you, once in a state of estrangement <alienation> and hostility <enmity> with respect to your intelligence <mind> in your base <wicked> works <deeds>, [22] at this moment he has reconciled again in the body of his flesh through death, in order to present <bring forward / prove> you holy <pure> and blameless <unblemished> and without reproach <blameless> in his presence <face to face with him>, [23] if (at least) you abide still <continue in> his <the> fidelity <faithfulness>, having your foundations laid <having been firmly founded> and steady <steadfast> and not shifting <changing place> away from the expectation <hope> of the gospel <good tidings> which you heard <to which you hearkened / which you obeyed / which you heeded>, the [gospel] having been proclaimed in every created thing <creature> under the sky <heavens>, of which I, Paul, became a deacon <servant / minister>. [24] Now I rejoice <delight/take pleasure> in my calamities <sufferings/passions> on behalf of you, and I fill up <complete> the deficiencies <shortcomings> of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body which is the church <assembly>, [25] of which I became a deacon <minister/servant> according to the arrangement <dispensation> of God having been granted --- to me for you  --- to make full <fulfill / consecrate*> the logos of God, [26] the sacrament <mystery / secret rite / secret doctrine> IMTO being in a state of being concealed <hidden, cf 3.3> after epochs <aeons> and after generations and <but> now revealed <made manifest> to his saints <holy ones / pure ones>, [27] to <by> whom God willed <was willing> to make known what is the wealth <riches> of the glory <vision/doctrine> of this sacrament <mystery> among the nations <Gentiles> which [the sacrament] is Christ in you <you all>, the expectation <hope> of <from/about> the glory <vision/doctrine>, [28] which <whom: sacrament or Christ> we announce <proclaim>, admonishing <warning> every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, in order that we may present <bring forward / prove, cf 1.22> every man (as) perfect <complete / finished> in Christ, [29] for which I also toil, contending <struggling> according to the energy <activity / active force> of him being energized <being activated / operating> in me in power <might>.

[2:1] For I am willing <want> you to know (an) extraordinary <great/big> struggle I have <hold> on behalf of you, (and) the ones in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face <countenance> in flesh <have not seen me in person>, [2] in order that their hearts may be cheered <encouraged>, having been joined together <instructed> in love and for <even unto> all (the) wealth <riches> of the full assurance IMTO of union <sagacity, cf 1.9 / understanding>, to recognition <knowledge, epigonwsin> of the sacrament <mystery> of God, Christ <sacrament or God? or: of God, and of the father, and of Christ>, [3] wherein all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are concealed <hidden, cf 3.3>.

[4] This I say in order that no one may delude you with sophistical arguments. [5] For even if with respect to the <my> flesh I am away <absent>, yet with respect to the <my> spirit with you I am, rejoicing <delighting> and beholding your good order <good arrangement> and the solidity of your fidelity to Christ.

[6] Therefore as <how> you took to yourself [as wife/mistress] Christ Jesus the lord, in him walk about <live>, [7] being rooted and built up in him and being confirmed <secured / established> in <by means of> your fidelity, even as you were taught, (and) abounding in gratitude <thankfulness>.

[8] Beware lest someone may lead you captive through philosophy and empty trickery <fraud/deceit> according to the tradition of men, according to the elemental spirits <signs of the zodiac> of their <the> cosmos, and not according to Christ, [9] because in him the whole fullness of the divine nature inhabits <colonizes/dwells> corporeally <bodily>, [10] and you are in him fulfilled <having been made full, look it up> who is the head of all rule <empire> and authority, [11] in whom also you were circumcised with divinely wrought circumcision <a circumcision wrought not by hands but>, by means of the stripping off <like clothes> the body, the flesh, by means of the circumcision of Christ, [12] you having been buried together with him in baptism in which also you rose together through the fidelity IMTO belonging to <from> the activity <operation> of God IMTO having roused <awakened / raised> him from among the dead ones.

[13] And you, being dead by means of <in> your blunders <transgressions/missteps> and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he [God] made you alive together with him, having forgiven <cf 3.13> to us all our blunders <missteps/transgressions>, [14] having cancelled <wiped out> the receipt <bond> against us with its legal ordinances <decrees> which was opposed <contrary> to us, and it he lifted away, having nailed it to the cross, [15] having despoiled <put off> the rulers <archons> and the authorities, he made an example <show> of them publicly <openly>, triumphing over them in him <God/Christ/the cross?>.

[16] Therefore may <let> no one adjudge <judge> you in eating and in drinking or in a matter of a festival or new moon or Sabbaths, [17] which are a shadow of the things destined to be, but the body is Christ's <belongs to Christ / of Christ>.

[18] May <let> no one disqualify you, relishing in the angels' self-abasement and worship <the abasement and worship which belongs to the angels / abasement and angel worship>, which things he sees, being initiated [into the mysteries] <which things he beheld in the visions of initiation>, rashly being puffed up by his fleshly mind, [19] and not holding fast to the head, from whom all the body, through the joints and sinews being furnished <supplied> and being brought <knit> together, increases <augments> with the divine increase <augmentation> [or: with the increase from God].

[20] If you died with [the help of? -yes] Christ from the elemental spirits <signs of the zodiac> of the cosmos <universe/world>, why, as though living in the cosmos, have you submitted <why submit> to ordinances <world> --- [21] "do not have intercourse; do not taste; do not touch" --- [22] (which things all are destined for destruction by consumption <being used up>), according to the "injunctions and teachings of men"? [23] Such things are having a reputation <report> of wisdom in wishful-worship <self-chosen worship> and self-abasement <cf 2.18> and severe <unsparing> treatment of the body, [but are] not of any value against the gratifying of the flesh.
<<what if the whole v23 is concessive? "injunctions and teachings of men", although such things are indeed reported as having wisdom in self-chosen worship and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, not in any honor to the gratifying <satisfying> of the flesh.>>

[3:1] If therefore you have been raised together with <by means of> Christ, seek the things on high <above>, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God. [2] Be intent on <be sensible to> the things on high, not the things upon the earth. [3] For you died and your life <means of living> is concealed <cf others; check greek> with [the help of? -yes] Christ in God [move "in God" earlier]. [4] Whenever Christ, the life <means of living> of you, is made manifest, at that time you also will be made manifest in glory.

[5] Kill off <mortify / make dead> therefore your members <limbs> IMTO upon the earth: prostitution, impurity, passion, base desire, and the greediness that is idolatry, [6] on account of which things the anger <wrath> of God is coming, [7] in which [things] even <also> you walked about at some time <once>, when you lived in them. [8] But now put away all things, you also: anger, wrath, baseness, slander, obscenity <shameful speech> from your mouths. [9] Do not lie to one another: having stripped off <put off> the antiquated man with his practices [10] and having assumed <put on, clothed yourself in, attire yourself in> the new IMTO being renewed unto knowledge <recognition, epignwsin> according to the likeness <semblance, cf earlier> of the one having created it, [11] whereof there is not <cannot be> Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free, but Christ is all and in all.

[12] Put on <attire yourself in> therefore, as elect of God <God''s selected> saints <holy ones, pure ones> and beloved, affections of pity, kindness, self-abasement <cf 2.18, 2.23>, gentleness, long-suffering, [13] patiently tolerating one another and forgiving yourselves <one another>. If someone <anyone> against someone <anyone> has censure <a complaint>, just as also the lord forgave you, in this way also you forgive <also should you>.

[14] And <but> in addition to all these [put on] love, which is a bond <fastening> of completeness <bond in completion?>. [15] And let <may> the peace of Christ arbitrate <judge/adjudge, cf 2.18> in your hearts, to which you were also summoned bodily <in one body, text. var.>. And become <be> thankful.

[16] Let <may> the logos <logos> of Christ dwell in you opulently, teaching and admonishing yourselves in all wisdom with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, chanting <singing> in your hearts to God in grace <gratitude>, [17] and every thing, which something if you may do in word or in work <deed>, all things in the name of the lord, Jesus, being thankful <returning thanks> to the divine father <God the father> through him.

[18] Women <wives>, subordinate yourselves <be subordinate> to your husbands <men>, as appertains to headship <as befits headship/authority, as is proper in lordship/headship/authority>. [19] Men, love your wives and do not be embittered <vexed> toward them.

[20] Children, heed <obey> your fathers <parents> according to <concerning> all things, for this is well pleasing to the head <to the authority/lord, pleasing in the presence of a lord/head/authority>. [21] Fathers, do not provoke your children, in order that they may not dishearten <lose heart, become disheartened>.

[22] Slaves, heed <obey> according to <concerning> all things your heads <masters/lords/HoHs> IMTO according to the natural order (word order), not in eye-service as man-pleasers <people-pleasures>, but in sincerity <lit. singleness> of heart, fearing the <your> lord <head/master/HoH>. [23] Whatever you do <make>, labor <work> from the soul <heartily, from the heart, lit. soul> as for <under> the <your> lord <master/authority/head>, and not men, [24] knowing that from (a?) lord <master/authority/head> you will receive back the repayment of the inheritance. You are slaves to the lord <master/authority/head>, Christ. [25] For the wrongdoer will be repaid the wrong, and there is not <no> favoritism.

[4:1] Lords <masters/heads>, provide <furnish> justice and fair dealing <equity/fairness> to your slaves, knowing that you have a lord <master/head> in the heavens <heaven>.

[2] Persist steadfastly in <be loyal to / devote yourselves to> prayer <the prayer, the place of prayer>, being wakeful in it in thanksgiving, [3] offering prayers at the same time also concerning us, in order that God may open to <for> us the word's door <a door of the word> to <so as to> speak the sacrament <mystery> of Christ, on account of which I am bound [4] in order that I will reveal <make manifest> it as I must <it is necessary/I ought> speak.

[5] In wisdom walk about <conduct yourselves> toward the outsiders, redeeming for yourselves the time. [6] Let <may> your speech always be graceful, prepared with salt, so as to know how you must <there is need> reply to <answer> each one.

[7] All my affairs Tychicus will make known to you --- the beloved brother and trustworthy <trusted> deacon <minister> and fellow-slave in (the) lord <master/head>, [8] whom I sent to you for this very purpose. In order that you may know the things concerning us <our circumstances> and that he may encourage your hearts, [9] together with Onesimus the <my/his/our> trustworthy <trusted> and beloved brother, who is one of yours, (switch before with after here) they will make known to you all things here.

[10] Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabus (concerning whom you received orders: "if he should come to you, accept <receive> him"), [11] and Jesus called Justus. These men only, being of circumcision, are colleagues <fellow-workers/accomplices> for the kingdom of God, who became to me a consolation.

[12] Epaphrus the slave of Christ Jesus greets you, one of yours, always struggling <contending> on your behalf in the <his> prayers, in order that you may be in a state of <rise up / stand firm> perfection <completion> and full satisfaction <assurance> in the whole will of God. [13] For I bear witness for him that he has much distress on behalf of you and of the men in Laodicea and of the men in Hierapolis.

[14] Luke the beloved doctor greets you, and Demas.

[15] Greet the brothers in Laodicea (and Nympha) and the church <assembly> at their house. [16] And when is read before you the letter <epistle>, see to it that it be read also in the Laodicean church and also that you read the letter <epistle> from Laodicea.

[17] And say to Archippus, "see to the diaconate <ministry> which you inherited in the lord, that you may fulfill it."

[18] The salutation, by my own hand, of Paul. Remember my fetters. Grace be with you.
