# Toward a Pauline Autobiography
*Copyright Joshua Kerr, 2018*

## Abstract
This paper explores the life of Paul from assumption that a *biography* and an *autobiography* are not the same thing: with no disrespect toward the various elements of biographical material concerning Paul that are to be found in various early Christian writings, this paper attempts to reconstruct those details of Paul's life which come from his own pen. This requires bracketing the biographical material from the *Acts of the Apostles*, the *Acts of Paul*, {>>more examples<<} and elsewhere in order to focus on a different question, *viz.*, the autobiographical one.

## Introduction
Scholars have long noted the striking differences between the portrait of Paul rendered in the *Acts of the Apostles* and that of the Pauline letters. In addition to countless attempts to account for this and other peculiarities of the structure and content of *Acts*, there have been countless attempts to reconcile its portrait of Paul with the epistolary materials. On the whole, these attempts at reconciliation have largely been received as failures within the scholarly community. It is not my purpose to rehash these arguments. At the same time, however, the portrait of Paul found in *Acts* continue to cast a long shadow over the scholarly imagination: we continue to think of Paul largely in the terms set down by the author of *Acts*. This paper ventures a different approach: what does Paul say about himself and his own life?

A word of caution: to differentiate between biographical and autobiographical materials is an experiment which does not in itself make judgments concerning the relative worth of the different bodies of literature. There may be reasons to consider Paul's letters to be more historically accurate than external accounts, or there may be reasons for the opposite assessment. This paper is not concerned with the *veracity* of any given portrait of Paul's life; rather, it is concerned with first discerning *what* the autobiographical portrait might entail.
