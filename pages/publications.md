## Refereed Journal Articles

#### “Spinoza: From Art to Philosophy,” *Philosophy Today* 64:1 (Winter 2020, forthcoming)

>Although Spinoza is often said to have little interest in sensual experience, I argue that his theory of knowledge implies that the experience of art contributes significantly to the development of rational knowledge.

#### “Thinking Through Sound: Martin Heidegger and Wallace Stevens,” *Journal of Speculative Philosophy* (Winter 2020, forthcoming)

>By reading Martin Heidegger's later philosophy of language in tension with Wallace Steven's poetry, this paper develops the problem of the *sense* of *sound* in language.

#### “Phytology, Between Φύσις and Ζώη,” *Kronos Philosophical Journal* (2019, forthcoming)

>I argue that Aristotle's study of plant life articulates a different kind of life that has more in common with nature (φύσις) than animal life (ζώη).
