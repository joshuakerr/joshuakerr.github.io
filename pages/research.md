### Overview

My research explores the role that plant life plays in philosophical discourses concerning nature, focusing primarily on ancient Greek and recent European philosophy. This work complements contemporary discussions concerning nature and the environment by highlighting the neglected place of the vegetal in the history of philosophy and recovering from that history new possibilities for contemporary thought. I also maintain an active secondary research agenda in the philosophy of language and literature, where I focus upon the embodied physicality of language and the resources it offers to philosophical reflection. In both cases, I am interested in the physical (Greek: φύσις) dimension of thinking.

### Current Projects

The next stage of my research agenda expands my work on vegetality from the ontological questions of my dissertation research to ethical questions concerning plant life and human-plant relations. In the context of Greek philosophy, plant life has an under-theorized but significant place in the origin of ethical reflection. Beginning with the concept of vegetal *hybris* developed in my dissertation, I will articulate questions concerning the ethical place of human beings in the cosmos vis-à-vis plant life, suggesting that plants offer a corrective challenge to traditionally anthropocentric ethical and cosmological theories.

### Dissertation

*The Hybris of Plants: Reinterpreting Philosophy through Vegetal Life*

My dissertation project explores the role of plant life in the history of western philosophy and the specific challenges vegetality poses to traditional philosophical thought. Commonplace as they may appear in our lives, few philosophers have concerned themselves with plants, and those who have done so have found precious little to say on the subject. Nevertheless, the handful of philosophers in the western tradition who take up the question of vegetal existence do so under the conviction that plants are a particularly suitable place to begin a project of philosophical inquiry. Aristotle, for example, reproaches his predecessors for erroneous theories of life precisely on the grounds that they neglected plants and therefore got started on the wrong foot. He suggests that plants, as the simplest and barest forms of life, are worthy of thoughtful consideration because they constitute a fruitful beginning for the analysis of living things. At the same time, however, these same philosophers are ultimately unable to give an account of vegetal existence. In Aristotle’s philosophy, for instance, plants quickly vanish, leaving a trace only as underdeveloped animals. Philosophy, then, has found itself inadequate to the task of thinking through plants.

My research attempts to account for the silence of philosophers concerning plants by engaging in careful examination of those philosophers for whom plants are not entirely forgotten, beginning with Plato and Aristotle’s often neglected studies of plant life. In each case, I show how vegetality is both constitutive in some way for the philosophical thinking in question and simultaneously an indigestible or unaccountable element within it. In my estimation, the manner of resistance plant life manifests vis-à-vis philosophy indicates an ontological valence of vegetality that calls for a fundamental rethinking of life as a manner of being. In its ambivalent encounters with philosophy, vegetal existence shows itself in terms of what I, following certain tendencies in Greek thought, call “*hybris*.” In this way, I intend to draw attention to the force whereby plant life composes itself in excess to its own limits (limits which themselves must be conceived as secondary to or derivative of vegetal hybris).

This project will be of considerable interest to philosophers who will find in my research a case for the ontological importance of vegetality and the introduction of *hybris* as a novel philosophical concept. Those who study the environmental humanities will find in my work a resource for both making sense of and reevaluating contemporary discourses concerning vegetality, which tend to project humanistic concerns upon plants and take for granted the transparency of vegetal life to conceptual analysis. The past century has seen many attempts to “de-center” the human being in philosophical thinking and to complicating the human/nature dichotomy through an insistence upon animality. My work offers a different approach in which the question of the human being is displaced dramatically in favor of an ontology that takes its original impetus from the vegetal and finds therein novel approaches to understanding existence.
