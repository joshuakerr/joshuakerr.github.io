### Overview

Diversity and inclusion are part of the fundamental mission of the university and integral to achieving academic excellence. I am dedicated to inclusive excellence, to developing opportunities for students traditionally underrepresented in the academy, and to enriching inquiry through the variety of perspectives and values that arise from diverse experiences.
