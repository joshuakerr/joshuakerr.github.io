## Toolchains

### Writing

After many trials, I have developed a solid toolchain that lets me compose, cite, and typeset consistently and without hassle.
    - **Zotero** for bibliography
        - Makes it easy to accumulate references. Optionally saves copies of materials, but I don't use this.
        - Plugin: BetterBibTex creates unique identifiers that make sense for use in markdown
    - **Markdown** for composition format
        - Separates composition and typesetting and encourages focus.
        - I use the modified markdown that pandoc supports for footnotes and citations.
    - **Atom** for composition software
        - Extremely powerful and customizable. Github integration is a big plus.
        - Plugins: Zen (distraction-free writing), editor-settings (settings based on file type), git-plus (GitHub integration), language-markdown, markdown-preview-plus, markdown-writer, wordcount (for use with Zen), zotero-citation (Zotero integration!!!).
    - **Pandoc** for typesetting
	    - I can go through LaTeX for nice PDFs. When sending things to a colleague to review, I can output in DOC.
	    - Pandoc can be scripted to assemble various files, which isolates typesetting definitions that are used across many documents.
