## Parenting

#### Rationale

Parenting is hard. While research shows that parenting decisions past a basic level of competency make little difference, there are still good reasons to review and implement sound parenting.

	- Small differences might still be of relative importance in life outcomes, especially given highly competitive situations.
	- A few very specific mistakes can make a big difference (the textbook example is lead exposure).
	- Parenting might produce anxiety, with parents feeling unsure of how they can be confident in their parenting choices. Following the best research can provide such confidence.
